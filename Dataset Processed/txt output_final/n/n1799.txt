watched and heard 4 thick branchs near the top of one the Pine trees in my backyard snapping under snow weight and taking branches with it.    I saw that, said oh crap, let's go have a look, ran out, look up, realized I was under the remainder and said oh crap, let's go back in.  It's Ragnarok!  Prepare for the end!
