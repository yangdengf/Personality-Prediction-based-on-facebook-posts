is currently reading Fooled by Randomness... Today I put my book down in the midst of a reverie at my airplane window and felt as if my brain were a  bad sieve, realizing that I was bound to forget most of the wonderful things I was reading... If only I could remember everything useful that I've learned and forgotten.
