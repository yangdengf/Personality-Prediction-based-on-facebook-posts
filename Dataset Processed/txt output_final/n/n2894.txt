has a big bet on the WSOP final table... I bet on PROPNAME to win vs PROPNAME to win against PROPNAME.  Any other winners is a tie. I figure PROPNAME is about 3:1 & PROPNAME is about 7.5:1 I loooove my bet right now (no odds!)  I wanted to book more action last night vs PROPNAME when I saw him at the Bellagio, but he doesn't like his side anymore.  Ship the EV kidd!!!!!
