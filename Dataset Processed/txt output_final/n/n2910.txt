is up a little too early in the morning (9:30AM)... and doesn't know what to do with himself.  I think I'm going to get some quality reading time with Chaos (PROPNAME)... btw there is a scale for the quality of your reading (how focused//distracted//tired, etc...), and right now i think my reading will be pretty solid
