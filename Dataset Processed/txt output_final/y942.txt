WHAT?  WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME THAT ZOMBIELAND WAS FILMED AT WILD ADVENTURES?!  So those guys trying to recruit LHS students for a big movie making fun of zombie movies filmed near WA and in the woods were actually legit!  OMG I have to go see it! Also, all you people in Valdosta fail for not telling me about it! ;)
