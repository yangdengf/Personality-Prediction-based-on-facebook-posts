The Soup The Verdict Type Vegetable Appearance Fantastic Texture Good Taste Poor Overall Edible but not pleasant Summary This is a great soup for looking at, it is full of colour, healthy vegetables and creaminess! If you are not hungry make this soup and you will feel good! However, if eating is your thing, this soup should be avoided. I have soup left for 3 meals - any takers? Only p&p to pay! Enjoy!
