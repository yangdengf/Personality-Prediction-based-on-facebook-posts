yesterday after school, i got bored and decided to go into the backyard and play with my slingshot. i didn't have any ammo, so i just used peanuts and shot them at trees. i decided to shoot at one really far away. out of nowhere, a squirrel leaped out of a tree, intercepted the peanut, landed on another tree, ate the peanut, gave me what looked like a thumbs-up, and ran away. ninja squirrel, you amaze me. mlia.
