wishes life weren't so gray-scale... There are things I fear that excite me, things I want that I'm not sure I want, things I'm doing that I wish I were not, things I should be doing that I dread, and things that I want to put off but can't wait to get over with.  WTH life, how about giving me 2+2 instead of [x^3-x^2]//[(x^2+9)^3dx]?
