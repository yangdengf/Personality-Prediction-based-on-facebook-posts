Due to a lack of anyone being interested in my life updates, I will write here and delude myself that someone wiill read it later and actually care...  Got a new phone yesterday: a Palm treo.  Had to pay 30 a mo extra to use it, but now I'll be able to use the interwebz while in White Bluff.  30 dollars is a fair price to put on cabin fever prevention. Maybe I should Tweet this too. :P
