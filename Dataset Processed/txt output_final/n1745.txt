just performed surgery on a lizard(Green Anole now named Tropical thunder), we bought from the pet store last night cause he looked near death.  He's doing well now, I think his leg is better, it's all about preventing complications//infections now. Pictures later. Time to go to PROPNAME's Bdat picnic.
