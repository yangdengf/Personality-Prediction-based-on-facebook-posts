update.  after i feel down the stairs last night, i stood up and proceeded to faint at which point keith came out and started slapping me asking if i was ok.  and in my head, i was responding just fine, but was apparently just mumbling to him.  if i wasn't in pain i would laugh :)  also, good to know that he's there for me when i need him
