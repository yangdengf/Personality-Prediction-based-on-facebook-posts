missed my connecting flight from atlanta to rio last night, i now have to spend 24 hours in atlanta to catch the same flight later today.  it's under freezing here, and i have no long-sleeve tops and a single pair of jeans.  Hello hotel room!  Time for movies!  I think I might be coming down with a cold too... wow, I hope it's a quick one that just goes away.
