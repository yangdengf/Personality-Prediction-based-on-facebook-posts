just had the most amazing weekend: 3rd Dan test went well, everyone passed with flying colors. Valentines day was spent well in the company of the best girlfriend in the world  PROPNAME. What more could I ask for? p.s. Thank you to everyone who could make it out to Novi to watch me test or to celebrate at the banquet afterward  it really means a lot to me.
