Face the facts. Then act on them. Its the only mantra I know, the only doctrine I have to offer you, and its harder than youd think, because I swear humans seem hardwired to do anything but. Face the facts. Dont pray, dont wish, dont buy into centuriesold dogma and dead rhetoric. Dont give in to your conditioning or your visions or your fuckedup sense of... whatever. FACE THE FACTS. THEN act.
