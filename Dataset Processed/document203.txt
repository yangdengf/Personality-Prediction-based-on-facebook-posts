Yesterday after school, I got bored and decided to go into the backyard and play with my slingshot. I didnt have any ammo, so I just used peanuts and shot them at trees. I decided to shoot at one really far away. Out of nowhere, a squirrel leaped out of a tree, intercepted the peanut, landed on another tree, ate the peanut, gave me what looked like a thumbsup, and ran away. Ninja squirrel, you amaze me. MLIA.
